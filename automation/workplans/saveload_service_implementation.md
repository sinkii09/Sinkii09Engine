## Technical Optimization Strategies

### Memory Optimization

2. **Streaming**: Process large saves in chunks to reduce memory footprint
3. **Weak References**: Use weak references for cached save metadata
4. **GC Optimization**: Minimize allocations during save/load operations

### I/O Optimization
1. **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are asynchronous with UniTask
2. **Buffered Streams**: Use buffered streams for better performance
3. **Parallel Processing**: Parallel serialization of independent data
4. **Memory-Mapped Files**: For large save files (>100MB)

### CPU Optimization
1. **Differential Serialization**: Only serialize changed data
2. **Compression Levels**: Configurable compression vs speed trade-offs
3. **Multi-threading**: Background compression and encryption
4. **SIMD Instructions**: Use SIMD for bulk data processing when available

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Large saves causing frame drops
   - **Mitigation**: Streaming serialization, background processing
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large saves consuming excessive memory

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Encryption implementation flaws
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven encryption libraries, security audits
2. **Version Compatibility**: Migration failures between save versions
