## ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

### **1. Object Pooling**
- **Actor Pool**: Reuse actor GameObjects to minimize allocation/deallocation
- **State Pool**: Pool actor state objects for save/load operations
- **Animation Pool**: Reuse animation/tween objects

### **2. Resource Management**
- **Reference Counting**: Track resource usage to prevent premature unloading
- **Smart Caching**: LRU cache for frequently used textures and assets
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed, unload when unused

### **3. Memory Pressure Response**
```csharp
public void RespondToMemoryPressure(MemoryPressureLevel level)
{
    switch (level)
    {
        case MemoryPressureLevel.Low:
            CleanupUnusedResources();
            break;
        case MemoryPressureLevel.Medium:
            ClearResourceCache();
            DeactivateInvisibleActors();
            break;
        case MemoryPressureLevel.High:
            EmergencyCleanup();
            break;
    }
}
```

### **4. Rendering Optimizations**
- **Sprite Batching**: Combine multiple sprites for efficient rendering
- **Texture Atlasing**: Pack small textures to reduce draw calls
- **Culling**: Hide off-screen actors from rendering pipeline

---

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Tests**

    }
    
    [Test]
    public async Task SaveLoadActorState_ShouldPreserveProperties()
    {
        // Test save/load integration
    }
    
    [Test]
    public async Task AnimateActor_ShouldRespectCancellation()
    {
        // Test animation cancellation
    }
}
```

### **Integration Tests**
- **Service Container Integration**: Verify proper service registration and resolution

## 📚 **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Actor Management**

```csharp
// Get actor service
var actorService = Engine.GetService<IActorService>();

// Create and show a character
var alice = await actorService.CreateActorAsync<ICharacterActor>("Alice");
await alice.ChangeAppearanceAsync("Alice.Happy", 1.0f);
await alice.ChangeVisibilityAsync(true, 1.0f);

// Move character to center position
await alice.ChangePositionAsync(Vector3.zero, 2.0f, EasingType.EaseInOut);
```

### **Script Commands**

```script
; Show Alice with happy expression at center
@show char:Alice.Happy pos:center fade:1.0

; Alice speaks with character color highlighting
@char Alice speak:"Hello! I'm excited to meet you!"

; Change Alice's expression and look direction
@char Alice appear:Surprised look:left duration:0.5

; Move Alice to left while Bob enters from right
@move char:Alice pos:left duration:1.5
@show char:Bob.Neutral pos:right fade:1.0 delay:0.5

; Change background with transition
@bg classroom transition:slide duration:2.0

; Remove all characters
@remove char:* fade:1.0
```

### **Advanced Usage**

```csharp
// Batch operations for multiple actors
var characters = new[] { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };
var tasks = characters.Select(name => 
    actorService.GetActorAsync<ICharacterActor>(name)
        .ContinueWith(actor => actor.Result?.ChangeVisibilityAsync(false, 1.0f))
);
await UniTask.WhenAll(tasks);

// Custom pose with state management
var pose = new CharacterState
{
    Position = new Vector3(-2, 0, 0),
    LookDirection = CharacterLookDirection.Right,
    Appearance = "Alice.Waving"
};
await alice.ApplyStateAsync(pose, 1.5f);

// Memory-efficient background preloading
await actorService.PreloadBackgroundsAsync(new[] { "classroom", "library", "cafeteria" });
```

public interface IVehicleActor : IActor
{
    float Speed { get; set; }
    VehicleType Type { get; set; }
    UniTask DriveToAsync(Vector3 destination, float speed, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

// 2. Create actor implementation
public class Vehicle : MonoBehaviourActor, IVehicleActor
{
    // Implementation details
}

// 3. Add to actor service registration
[ActorType("vehicle")]
public class VehicleManager : ActorManager<IVehicleActor, VehicleState, VehicleMetadata>
{
    // Manager implementation
}
```

### **Extending Command System**

```csharp
[CommandAlias("drive")]
public class DriveVehicleCommand : ICommand
{
    [RequiredParameter]
    public CommandParameter<string> VehicleId { get; set; }
    
    [RequiredParameter]
    public CommandParameter<Vector3> Destination { get; set; }
    
    public async UniTask ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var actorService = Engine.GetService<IActorService>();
        var vehicle = await actorService.GetActorAsync<IVehicleActor>(VehicleId.Value);
        await vehicle.DriveToAsync(Destination.Value, 5.0f, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```
