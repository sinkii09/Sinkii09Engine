## Performance Targets

### Save/Load Performance
- **Small Saves** (<1MB): <100ms total time
- **Medium Saves** (1-10MB): <500ms total time
- **Large Saves** (>10MB): <2s total time
- **Memory Overhead**: <20% of save file size

### Storage Efficiency
- **Compression Ratio**: 60-80% size reduction
- **Encryption Overhead**: <5% performance impact
- **Concurrent Operations**: Support 4+ simultaneous saves
- **Error Recovery**: >99.9% success rate

### Memory Management
- **Peak Memory Usage**: <2x save file size
- **GC Pressure**: <10% increase during operations
- **Memory Leaks**: Zero tolerance policy
- **Object Pooling**: 80% reduction in allocations

## Technical Optimization Strategies

### Memory Optimization
1. **Object Pooling**: Reuse serialization buffers and temporary objects
2. **Streaming**: Process large saves in chunks to reduce memory footprint
3. **Weak References**: Use weak references for cached save metadata
4. **GC Optimization**: Minimize allocations during save/load operations

### I/O Optimization
1. **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are asynchronous with UniTask
2. **Buffered Streams**: Use buffered streams for better performance
3. **Parallel Processing**: Parallel serialization of independent data
4. **Memory-Mapped Files**: For large save files (>100MB)

### CPU Optimization
1. **Differential Serialization**: Only serialize changed data
2. **Compression Levels**: Configurable compression vs speed trade-offs
3. **Multi-threading**: Background compression and encryption
4. **SIMD Instructions**: Use SIMD for bulk data processing when available

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Large saves causing frame drops
   - **Mitigation**: Streaming serialization, background processing
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large saves consuming excessive memory
   - **Mitigation**: Chunked processing, memory pressure monitoring
3. **Data Corruption**: Save file corruption during write operations
   - **Mitigation**: Atomic writes, checksums, automatic backup
4. **Platform Compatibility**: Different behavior across platforms
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive platform testing, platform-specific optimizations

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Encryption implementation flaws
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven encryption libraries, security audits
2. **Version Compatibility**: Migration failures between save versions
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive migration testing, rollback capabilities
3. **Integration Issues**: Conflicts with existing service architecture
   - **Mitigation**: Careful dependency analysis, incremental integration
