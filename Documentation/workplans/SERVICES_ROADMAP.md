## üìä Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (8-10 weeks)
1. DialogueService
2. StoryService 
3. LocalizationService
4. SettingsService

### Phase 2: Enhancement (6-8 weeks)
1. InputService
2. ConfigurationService
3. CameraService

### Phase 3: Polish (5-7 weeks)
1. EffectsService
2. AnimationService

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Considerations

### Service Dependencies
```
DialogueService -> AudioService, UIService, ActorService
StoryService -> DialogueService, SaveLoadService, UIService
LocalizationService -> ResourceService, AudioService, UIService
InputService -> UIService, SettingsService
CameraService -> ActorService, AnimationService
EffectsService -> ResourceService, CameraService
AnimationService -> ActorService, UIService
```

### Integration Points
- All services follow the existing `IEngineService` pattern
- Use existing `ServiceConfiguration` system for setup
- Integrate with current `ResourceService` for asset loading
- Leverage `SaveLoadService` for state persistence
- Work within established actor and UI systems

## üìù Notes

### Code Standards
- Follow existing CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Use ScriptableObject configurations
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add performance monitoring where needed

### Testing Strategy
- Create service-specific test scenes
- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for service interactions
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths
