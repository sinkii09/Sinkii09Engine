### Dependencies
- UniTask 2.3.3 - Modern async/await patterns

- Unity Addressables 2.2.2 - Advanced resource management

### Requirements
- Unity 2022.3+ (Unity 6 recommended)
- .NET Standard 2.1 or higher

## Version History

- **0.2.0** - Addressable integration and performance optimizations
- **0.1.0** - Initial release with core service architecture

## Breaking Changes

### 0.2.0
- `ProviderType` enum order changed - Addressable is now first priority
- Default `ResourceServiceConfiguration` now enables Addressable + Resources instead of Resources + AssetBundle

### 0.1.0
- Initial release - no breaking changes

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 0.2.0

1. **Update Package**: Use Unity Package Manager to update to 0.2.0
2. **Addressables Setup**: If using Addressables, ensure your catalog is properly configured
3. **Configuration Update**: ResourceService configurations will automatically prioritize Addressables
4. **No Code Changes**: Existing resource loading code remains unchanged

```csharp
// This still works the same way
var texture = await resourceService.LoadResourceAsync<Texture2D>("UI/Background");
// Now tries Addressables first, then falls back to Resources
```

## Planned Features

### 0.3.0 (Next Release)
- **UI System** - Complete UI management framework
- **Audio System** - Advanced audio management with mixing
- **Animation System** - Enhanced animation tools
- **Event System** - Pub/sub messaging framework

### 0.4.0
- **Networking** - Multiplayer foundation
- **Localization** - Multi-language support  
- **Asset Bundles** - Full AssetBundle provider implementation
- **Cloud Storage** - Advanced cloud save integration
